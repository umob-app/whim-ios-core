# üó∫Ô∏è Map

A toolkit for managing multiple map layers which are responsible for interacting with the shared abstract map.

## Overview

![A high level overview of the map structure](map)

As described in the <doc:Navigation> document, Map component solves problem of sharing the same map between different screens while providing a structured approach for a screen to control the map while it is being presented.

### Shared Abstract Map

Overall sharing a single map between different screens can be a tedious task. It can be difficult to guarantee that once one screen has a reference to the map, it won't address it while another screen needs to be in control of the map, which can lead to chaos. Hence a certain level of abstraction can provide a better control over the ownership of the right to mutate the map.

Let's introduce a notion of a layer which will contain data to be rendered on the map, and a manager which will be responsible for managing layers and switching between them.
There can be only one active layer at a time rendered by the map. While a layer is active, the map renders its data and passes its events to that layer, however when the layer becomes inactive it doesn't receive new map events. A layer can switch between active and inactive states as many times as needed. A layer is only created by the manager when requested to register a new layer.

Ideally a layer's lifetime reflects a UIViewController lifetime:
- we register a new layer in the manager when view controller is being created
- we activate a layer in the manager when view controller receives viewWillAppear
- we deactivate a layer in the manager when view controller receives viewWillDisappear
- we remove a layer from the manager when view controller is deallocated
However there's no strict policy for that (it's just a recommendation to keep things in order), so you can configure your custom lifecycle for your map layers.

Whoever activates their map layer, gains the control over the map, which means previous owning layer is deactivated automatically. 
There's no priority or other mechanisms to reserve a layer only for yourself - so everyone can activate their map layer at any time, meaning deactivating others.

Whenever a map layer manager switches layers, it notifies the map to render itself according to a new layer.
