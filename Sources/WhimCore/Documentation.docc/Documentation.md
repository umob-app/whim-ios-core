# ``WhimCore``

Core utilities and architecture components for iOS applications.

## Overview

WhimCore provides tools for building a unidirectional modular architecture which easily co-exists with the rest of you app, UI kit for building complex navigation flows and controlling the shared map layer in a structured manner. On top of that there's an implementation of GeoHash data structure and ProximityHash algorithm which makes caching of the circular or rectangular areas a breeze.
